# Equation Solvers

The SciML Equation Solvers cover a large set of `SciMLProblem`s with `SciMLAlgorithm`s
that are efficient, numerically stable, and flexible. These methods tie into libraries
like SciMLSensitivity.jl to be fully differentiable and compatible with machine
learning pipelines, and are designed for integration with applications like parameter
estimation, global sensitivity analysis, and more.

## LinearSolve.jl: Unified Interface for Linear Solvers

[LinearSolve.jl](https://github.com/SciML/LinearSolve.jl) is the canonical library

The well-optimized DifferentialEquations solvers benchmark as some of the fastest
implementations of classic algorithms. It also includes algorithms from recent
research which routinely outperform the "standard" C/Fortran methods, and algorithms
optimized for high-precision and HPC applications. Simultaneously, it wraps
the classic C/Fortran methods, making it easy to switch over to them whenever
necessary. Solving differential equations with different methods from
different languages and packages can be done by changing one line of code,
allowing for easy benchmarking to ensure you are using the fastest method possible.

## JumpProcesses.jl: Stochastic Simulation Algorithms for Jump Processes, Jump-ODEs, and Jump-Diffusions

[JumpProcesses.jl](https://github.com/SciML/JumpProcesses.jl) is the library for Poisson jump
processes, also known as chemical master equations or Gillespie simulations, for simulating
chemical reaction networks and other applications. It allows for solving with many methods,
including:

- `Direct`: the Gillespie Direct method SSA.
- `RDirect`: A variant of Gillespie's Direct method that uses rejection to
  sample the next reaction.
- *`DirectCR`*: The Composition-Rejection Direct method of Slepoy et al. For
  large networks and linear chain-type networks it will often give better
  performance than `Direct`. (Requires dependency graph, see below.)
- `DirectFW`: the Gillespie Direct method SSA with `FunctionWrappers`. This
  aggregator uses a different internal storage format for collections of
  `ConstantRateJumps`.
- `FRM`: the Gillespie first reaction method SSA. `Direct` should generally
  offer better performance and be preferred to `FRM`.
- `FRMFW`: the Gillespie first reaction method SSA with `FunctionWrappers`.
- *`NRM`*: The Gibson-Bruck Next Reaction Method. For some reaction network
   structures this may offer better performance than `Direct` (for example,
   large, linear chains of reactions). (Requires dependency graph, see below.)
- *`RSSA`*: The Rejection SSA (RSSA) method of Thanh et al. With `RSSACR`, for
  very large reaction networks it often offers the best performance of all
  methods. (Requires dependency graph, see below.)
- *`RSSACR`*: The Rejection SSA (RSSA) with Composition-Rejection method of
  Thanh et al. With `RSSA`, for very large reaction networks it often offers the
  best performance of all methods. (Requires dependency graph, see below.)
- *`SortingDirect`*: The Sorting Direct Method of McCollum et al. It will
  usually offer performance as good as `Direct`, and for some systems can offer
  substantially better performance. (Requires dependency graph, see below.)

The design of JumpProcesses.jl composes with DifferentialEquations.jl, allowing for
discrete stochastic chemical reactions to be easily mixed with differential
equation models, allowing for simulation of hybrid systems, jump diffusions,
and differential equations driven by Levy processes.

In addition, JumpProcesses's interfaces allow for solving with regular jump methods,
such as adaptive Tau-Leaping.

# Third Party Libraries to Note

## JuMP.jl: Julia for Mathematical Programming

While Optimization.jl is the preferred library for nonlinear optimization, for all
other forms of optimization
[Julia for Mathematical Programming (JuMP)](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) is
the star. JuMP is the leading choice in Julia for doing:

- Linear Programming
- Quadratic Programming
- Convex Programming
- Conic Programming
- Semidefinite Programming
- Mixed-Complementarity Programming
- Integer Programming
- Mixed Integer (nonlinear/linear) Programming
- (Mixed Integer) Second Order Conic Programming

JuMP can also be used for some nonlinear programming, though the Optimization.jl bindings
to the JuMP solvers (via MathOptInterface.jl) is generally preferred.

## FractionalDiffEq.jl: Fractional Differential Equation Solvers

[FractionalDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciFracX/FractionalDiffEq.jl) is a set of
high-performance solvers for fractional differential equations.

can in many cases out-perform the OrdinaryDiffEq.jl nonautonomous operator ODE solvers
by using methods specialized on manifold definitions of ManifoldsBase.
